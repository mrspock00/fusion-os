	\struct entry_ref
	\ingroup storage
	\ingroup libbe
	\brief A filesystem entry represented as a name in a concrete directory.

	entry_refs may refer to pre-existing (concrete) files, as well as
	non-existing (abstract) files. However, the parent directory of the file
	\b must exist.

	The result of this dichotomy is a blending of the persistence gained by
	referring to entries with a reference to their internal filesystem node and
	the flexibility gained by referring to entries by name.

	For example, if the directory in which the entry resides (or a directory
	further up in the hierarchy) is moved or renamed, the entry_ref will still
	refer to the correct file (whereas a pathname to the previous location of
	the file would now be invalid).

	On the other hand, say that the entry_ref refers to a concrete file. If the
	file itself is renamed, the entry_ref now refers to an abstract file with
	the old name (the upside in this case is that abstract entries may be
	represented by entry_refs without preallocating an internal filesystem node
	for them).

	\a name may refer to either a pre-existing file in the given directory, or
