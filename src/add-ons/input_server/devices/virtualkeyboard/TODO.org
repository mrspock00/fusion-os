* TODO Improve the drawing of both Keymap and VirtualKeyboard (Same code)
* TODO Create a handler class so that Keyboard View does not know about input device
* TODO Add a window to change layout, font, and maps. The functions to load the items are already there! Just need to create a settings directory for preferences.
* TODO The held down keys (ctrl, caps, shift, alt, etc) have an issue where they stay down. To replicate click one of the listed keys. Click an alphabet key. Then try click the held down key again. The key will stay stuck

* TODO factor-out code common to both Keymap and VirtualKeyboard
* TODO handle B_KEY_MAP_CHANGED and B_KEY_LOCKS_CHANGED
