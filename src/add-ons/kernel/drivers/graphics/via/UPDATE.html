<p><h2>Changes done for each driverversion:</h2></p>
<p><h1>via_driver (Haiku repository 0.19, Rudolf)</h1></p>
<ul>
	<li>Initial setup based on nVidia driver 0.30;
	<li>Kerneldriver uses MTR-WC mapping where available;
	<li>Accelerant uses AGP busmanager to enable AGP FW where available;
	<li>Added hardware cursor;
	<li>Added RAM size autodetection, as preset by the system BIOS;
	<li>Added support for virtualscreens (CRTC startadress and memory pitch programming);
	<li>Added CRTC1 timing programming and updated constraints, including GET_TIMING_CONSTRAINTS hook;
	<li>Added mode colordepth programming;
	<li>Added CRTC FIFO fetch limit programming (seems specific to VIA);
	<li>Added colorpalette programming;
	<li>Added DPMS support;
	<li>Added primary head pixelPLL programming (refreshrate is now set);
	<li>Added switch to 'enhanced mode' making the driver independant from a preset VESA mode;
	<li>Added video overlay support;
	<li>Finalized virtualscreen panning granularity constraints programming;
	<li>Added returning correct information in GET_ACCELERANT_DEVICE_INFO (displayed in Haiku screenprefs panel);
	<li>Fixed wrong PLL registerdefines for K8M800 and added seperate pixelPLL calculation routine: K8M800 now works correctly whereas previously you'd have a black screen (tested different resolutions, refreshrates and colordepths);
	<li>Fixed blocking overlay hooks if current videomode is not supported (before overlay could kick in while it should not, resulting in bad video or desktop pictures);
	<li>Fixed K8M800 video overlay: apparantly the engine was modified for this revision of the Unichrome video chipset: at least the 'V1' engine doesn't work here, while ' V3' does (using V3 now on K8M800);
	<li>Added overlay support on system memory types DDR 166 and DDR 200. Before on these memory types overlay would block.
</ul>
<p><h1>Still todo:</h1></p>
<ul>
	<li>2D acceleration;
	<li>And yet more could be done.
</ul>
