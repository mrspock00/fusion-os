The provider database is simply a collection of files with attributes. To add
new provider to the image rdef files are used. In the jam file you have to add
the new provider name. Here an example rdef file:
 
resource(1, "POP Server") "pop.gmx.net";
resource(2, "IMAP Server") "imap.gmx.net";
resource(3, "SMTP Server") "mail.gmx.de";
resource(4, "POP Authentication") 0;
resource(5, "SMTP Authentication") 1;
resource(6, "POP SSL") 0;
resource(7, "IMAP SSL") 0;
resource(8, "SMTP SSL") 0;
resource(9, "Username Pattern") 0;
 
 
you can pass the following options to the last six items:
 
"POP Authentication":
	0	plain text
	1	APOP
 
"SMTP Authentication":
	0	none
	1	ESMTP
	2	POP3 before SMTP

"POP SSL":
	0	No encryption
	1	SSL
 
"IMAP SSL":
	0	No encryption
	1	SSL
 
"SMTP SSL":
	0	Unencrypted

"Username Pattern":
