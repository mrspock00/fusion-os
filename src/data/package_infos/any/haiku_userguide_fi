summary			"The Haiku user documentation (Finnish translation)"
description		"The user guide describes the Haiku operating system from a \
user's perspective.
It's recommended reading for people that are new to the system as well as the \
seasoned Haiku or former BeOS user. It describes the fundamentals of the \
graphical user interface as well as the special features that are unique to \
the BeOS/Haiku system. All included applications and preferences are \
described in detail and tips and little workshops help to work most \
efficiently under Haiku.

This is the Finnish translation of the user guide. Thanks to everyone who \
contributed!"
