# Initialisation script for GDB to help debugging the Haiku ARM port with qemu.
# Setup the gdbinit from reverse.put.as, then run gdb -x thisscript from the
# generated dir. This will set everything up for you so you can start debugging
# right away.

# Needs http://reverse.put.as/gdbinit/

# Set ARM mode
arm
# Show context on events
context-on

# Below are regular gdb commands (no need for that funky gdbinit script!)

# Connect to qemu
target remote localhost:1234

# Show readable C++ symbols in asm listings
set print asm-demangle on

# Load the bootloader symbols so we can see what we're doing
symbol-file objects/haiku/arm/release/system/boot/boot_loader_u-boot

# Set a breakpoint at our entry point, so we can watch things roll after the
# boring part of u-boot loading everything in RAM
